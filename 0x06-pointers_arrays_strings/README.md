# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## 0-strcat.c
This c code concatenates two strings.
The variables index and dest_len are decleared and initialised to zero for storing counting in the loops and to store the length of destination file respectively.
The while loop checks that while destination string is not yet 0 increment the index count while in the loop it increments the the variable holding destination length. so at the end dest_len has the length of destination string.

Then the for loop does the appending by initializing index var to 0 and checkingthat its not at the end of src string and in the loop we equal the end of destination string to the start of src string.
